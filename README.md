# AI Curriculum
Open Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning lectures from top Universities like Stanford, MIT, UC Berekeley.

## MIT 6.S191: Introduction to Deep Learning | 2020
[Lecture Series](http://introtodeeplearning.com/)

MIT's introductory course on deep learning methods with applications to computer vision, natural language processing, biology, and more! Students will gain foundational knowledge of deep learning algorithms and get practical experience in building neural networks in TensorFlow. Course concludes with a project proposal competition with feedback from staff and panel of industry sponsors. Prerequisites assume calculus (i.e. taking derivatives) and linear algebra (i.e. matrix multiplication), we'll try to explain everything else along the way! Experience in Python is helpful but not necessary. Listeners are welcome!
